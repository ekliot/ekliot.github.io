I'm a student of **Computer Science** at the **[Rochester Institute of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/)**, minoring in **English** and **Creative Writing**.

Currently my studies are focused on computer graphics and artificial intelligence, which I seek to apply to my passions of **game development** and **interactive storytelling**.

I see software design as a narrative, where strong software is crafted with consideration to *how* the user experiences that narrative.

Ultimately, I aim to bridge my technical discipline to my creative passions to craft experiences told in more than just words and dialogue, but interactivity and the emotional responses that result.

My current coursework is:
* **Global Illumination** // A breakdown of computer graphics into an analogy of photography for ray tracing, detailed [here](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.rit.edu/science/article/pii/S0097849304002237)
* **Biologically-Inspired Intelligent Systems** // A study of computational models inspired by human cognitive patterns
* **Game-Based Fiction Workshop** // A course on the use of tabletop RPGs as an engine for transmedia storytelling, with a course wiki organized [here](https://ageoftheempire.wikispaces.com/ENGL+543+-+Game-based+Fiction+Workshop)
