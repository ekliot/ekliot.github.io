My name is Elijah Kliot, I'm a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where I study computer science. Right now, I am finishing my seventh semester of study at RIT, with an expected graduation in 2019. I chose computer science both out of a passion for the subject, in particular algorithms and intelligent systems, as well as a stepping stone on the path to game development. For me, game development is an art, a creative harmony between mechanical design and narrative expression.

My greatest creative inspirations have been Robert E Howard, creator of Conan the Barbarian and Solomon Kane, as well as Edmund McMillen, creator of Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy.

Outside of school and projects, I spend my time training gymnastics, bouldering, and [longsword technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts), as well as playing a fair share of role-playing games.
