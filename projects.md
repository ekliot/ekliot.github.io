*Project pages soon to come.*

My current efforts include:

* **Ray tracing renderer** // implemented in C++ with a partner for my Global Illumination course.
* **City of Yattoh** // a turn-based tactics game in Unity3D with a focus on evolutionary tactics
* **gl-ph** // RIT's upcoming digital literature journal, where I am currently working on web development

Projects I am not actively working on are:

* **Conangen** // A Rails application for the management of player-characters in an RPG based on the Conan property
* **Arco** // A competitive card game built in Haxe, on deck to be redesigned for a single-player experience in Godot
* **Heresim** // A simulation of intrigue and deception, with an AI storyteller
* **Wilson's Diet Planner** // A reference site for planning a diet with [Wilson's Disease](http://wilsonsdisease.ca/about-wilson-disease), using data pulled from the [USDA NDB](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/)
